/*
  How to use it:
  - In this example, Reduce accepts two parameters, the total and the current amount.
  - The reduce method cycles through each number in the array much like it would in a for-loop.
  - When the loop starts the total value is the number on the far left (29.76) and the current amount is the one next to it (41.85).
  - In this particular example, we want to add the current amount to the total.
  - The calculation is repeated for each amount in the array, but each time the current value changes to the next number in the array, moving right.
  - When there are no more numbers left in the array the method returns the total value.
